   <p>Approach:
    Firstly, create the overall layout or the structure of the application using HTML elements like etc.
    When the structure becomes ready, then the next task is to style the application with attractive styling properties of CSS. Some of the styling properties that we have used to style the application are background-color, margin, text-align, font-size etc.
    Once the styling of the application is done, then we can write the code for the functionality of verification in the JavaScript file.
    Using the Math.floor() and Math.random() functions in JavaScript, we generate the 4-digit numerical OTP when the Generate OTP button is clicked by the user.
    Using the if-else conditions, we are verifying the OTP by checking the Generated OTP and Inputted OTP matching. If this matches then the OTP gets verified and the Generate OTP button gets enabled for the user to generate more OTP.</p>
